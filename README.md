# Repository used for exercising before the exam

__Using this repository to exercise before the exam__

## Motivation

In order to have enough practice with GitHub, I need to exercise. Therefore, I have created this repository. 

## Method and results

The method that I have decided on is to do a mini project that includes all of the necessary steps.

The results will hopefully be a passing grade on the exam! :)

## Repository overview

This repository consists of the following folders and files: 
1) ***src folder*** that includes two subfolders: ***Analysis*** and ***Data_prep***
2) The ***Analysis*** folder includes makefile, pivot table, and two plots
3) The ***Data_prep*** folder includes clean file, download file, and makefile
4) There are also three separate files .gitignore, README.md, and makefile

## About
This repository is part of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/) course exam in [Tilburg University](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/). It has been created by me, [Polina Petkova](https://github.com/polinapetkova), and everyone can contribute to it after my exam is graded.
